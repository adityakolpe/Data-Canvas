# Outline

This project focuses on exploring the leading factors of heart disease across different age groups and lifestyle patterns. Using the dataset provided, we aim to uncover how variables such as physical activity, smoking habits, sleep patterns, BMI, and chronic health conditions influence the risk of heart disease. Additionally, we intend to analyze demographic factors like race, sex, and socioeconomic indicators to provide a nuanced understanding of heart health disparities. The goal is to create compelling visualizations that not only highlight trends and correlations but also offer actionable insights for health improvement and disease prevention.

Our story emphasizes the interplay of personal health choices and environmental factors in shaping cardiovascular outcomes. Through the lens of diverse visual narratives, we aim to guide our audience to the following takeaways:
1. Identification of the most critical predictors of heart disease.
2. Differences in risk profiles across demographic and lifestyle categories.

Project Structure

Introduction: 
Framing the Story
Purpose: Introduce the projectâ€™s goal of identifying leading factors of heart disease.
Relevance: Highlight the rising global burden of cardiovascular diseases and the importance of lifestyle modifications.
Data Context: Brief overview of the dataset, including its scope (states, demographics, and health metrics) and limitations.

Part 1: Setting the Stage
Exploratory Analysis:
Summary statistics of the dataset: Age distribution, prevalence of heart disease, and key lifestyle factors.
Visualizations: Bar charts for categorical data like smoking status, line plots for age and heart disease correlation.
User Story:
As a public health analyst, I want to understand the basic demographic and lifestyle profiles of individuals with heart disease to develop targeted interventions.

Part 2: Diving into the Data
Key Lifestyle Factors:
Correlation analysis between heart disease and variables like physical activity, smoking, sleep, and BMI.
Visualizations: Scatter plots and heatmaps showing the strength of relationships.
Chronic Conditions:
Analysis of comorbidities such as diabetes, arthritis, and asthma in individuals with heart disease.
Visualizations: Stacked bar charts comparing health conditions across heart disease categories.
User Story:
As a policy-maker, I want to know which lifestyle and health conditions are most correlated with heart disease to allocate resources effectively.

Part 3: Unearthing Demographic Disparities
Age and Gender:
Trends in heart disease risk by age group and gender.
Visualizations: Line graphs for age categories, stratified by gender.
Race and Socioeconomic Factors:
Differences in heart disease prevalence among racial/ethnic groups.
Visualizations: Boxplots and population heatmaps to illustrate disparities.
User Story:
As a healthcare provider, I want to identify high-risk demographic groups to create tailored health programs.

Part 4: Putting It All Together
Story Synthesis:
Combine insights from lifestyle factors and demographic disparities to identify critical risk patterns.
Visualizations: Sankey diagrams or decision trees mapping pathways to heart disease risk.
User Story:
As an individual, I want actionable recommendations to reduce my risk of heart disease.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
