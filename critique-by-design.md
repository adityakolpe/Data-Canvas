# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

I selected [Liam's NYC Slice data visualization](https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/) because of my genuine interest in pizza and my constant quest to find affordable yet delicious pizza spots. This visualization offers an engaging way to explore various pizza options across New York City, highlighting locations, prices, and other useful information. 

Beyond my personal love for pizza, I appreciate how this visualization simplifies the search for budget-friendly pizza places. It makes the data accessible and fun, allowing users to compare options at a glance, which aligns perfectly with my goal of discovering great pizza at reasonable prices.

## Step two: the critique
Overall observations about the data visualization:
What stood out to me?  What did I find that worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would I do differently?
-> Overall the visualization is informative and makes me want to eat more pizza (I already had 2 in the last 3 days). I am going to NYC later this month and I wanted to know where should I have an affordable pizza. As the dots on the map represent the places, we do not have a year filter so we need to hover over each dot and see if it is the latest year. I would love to have a year filter so that I can easily filter by year.

Primary audience:
Primary audience are the people who love pizza (like me and Joey from friends). This visualization is effective in helping us understand the prices at which the shops sold a slice of pizza in that year.

Anything missing?
I would add a year filter so that I can look at the latest prices and choose a shop to actually go have pizza there. I would also include a trends plot which would tell us the price trend of a slice of pizza at that particular place over the years. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
